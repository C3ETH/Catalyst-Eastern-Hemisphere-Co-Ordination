## ETH-Infrastructure

[Toc]

## 1 - Identify cohort reporting standards we can automate.

### Background

#### Cohort Reporting formats

There are source materials at [Fund 5, Developer Ecosystem - Governance Detail](https://stephen-rowan.gitbook.io/quality-assurance-dao/fund-5-proposals/fund-5-developer-ecosystem-governance-detail) .

There are now two cohort reporting forms. One for "Progress reporting" on the 10th of each month and one for "KPI reporting" on the 20th of each month. 



### Initial design

The basic deliverables are 1) a means to input reporting data via a form and 2) automation of the reporting timetable.

#### GitHub Form

#### GitHub Action



## 2 - Start with an audit of what projects to include.
