## Protocol

This project will be documented with the goal to create an outcoming protocol that can be used to onboard and introduce other communities into the Catalyst Ecosystem. This project is a very first community bridge-building prototype and will iterate and increase over time by practice.

The practice advantages lies in a highly dynamic and flexible mechanism, which is always able to experiment, adjust and grow by practice. The protocol and eventual solutions will be created by a “practice-first” approach. Create theory out of practice-proven mechanisms from the bottom up.
